### Dialysis_Tracker_App

### Work in Progress

- I just recently got this idea for an app that helps dialysis patients (including myself) keep track of important factors of their health. Some of the ideas for functions of the app include: 

1. Food Scanner: This would be similar to scanners used in dieting apps, such as weight watchers, but the difference would be that the app gives you information about the food's phosphorus and potassium contents, as those are the primary things dialsysis patients should avoid. 

2. Dialysis Center Finder: A quick map that would find centers that are available and in network for users when planning to travel. Finding a center is critical as travel is not possible otheriwse. 

3. Liquid Intake Tracker: Users would insert their target weight as instructed by physician, and their daily liquid limit. The app helps track how much liquids have been consumed in the day and how much they have alloted for the day. I was also thinking of adding "weight check ins" in which the user could enter their current weight and the app would tell them how much liquids they can expect to take off during their next session. 

4. Calander: A simple calander to track when their dialysis appointments are to better meange treatments, can also send reminders beforehand. 

5. Tratment Summary: A quick summary of each treatment, asks some questions and guages how it went based on given info, can aoso be used in liquid tracker to see what the weight should be.

6. Blood Preasure: If user connects a watch would be able to measure and record their blood pressure and heart rate, this can be useful in tracking users blood pressure, unsure of this feature for now.
